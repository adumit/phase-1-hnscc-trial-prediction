# phase-1-hnscc-trial-prediction
Create and evaluate exploratory prediction model for phase 1 HNSCC clinical trial.

The code in this repository produces the results of the random forest model in the paper titled: "Towards a mechanistic understanding of patient response to neoadjuvant SBRT with anti-PDL1 in human HPV-unrelated locally advanced HNSCC: phase I/Ib trial results"

To run the code perform the follow:

1) Clone the repository. The data is already present in the repository and was compiled by hand from the raw data, which is available for download.
2) Change directory to the repository
3) Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4) Run the script with `python3 generate_results.py`. Optionally, you may edit arguments of where to write files or the number of trials to run by editing the variables at the top of the script.
